faq_text_1_current_rank = "Behind the bar you can see 3 numbers. The first number is the number of points which are at least required for you rank.
The number in the middle displays your current number of points and the last number is the number of points you need to advance
to the next rank.<br />
The bar is calculated by the following: At first you have to substract the first number from the last. Then you have to substract
the first number from the second. Now you have to calculate the percentual value of this two values.<br />
<br />
Probably you have realized that this is quite difficult to explain. Therefore I'll give you an example: <br />
Assume that your bar looks like the following:<br />
<img alt=\"experience diagram\" src=\"%s\" align=\"bottom\" /> (15,18,25)<br />
Now we apply the mentioned operations and receive: The user has 3 (18-15) of
10 (25-15) in the current rank. This would be 30%%."
faq_text_1_continuous = "The diagram displays the overall experience of the user. The upper limit is the number of points of the last rank.<br />
So we take the maximum possible number of points and look how many the user has. The filled area of the diagram represents
the procentual &quot;completion&quot; of the points.<br />
For example:<br />
We have 18 points and the last rank has 25 points. Then we calculate the percentual value:<br />
100 * (18 / 25) = 72 %%<br />
Therefore we get the following experience-diagram:<br />
<img alt=\"experience diagram\" src=\"%s\" align=\"bottom\" /><br />
<br />
The circle on the left represents the percentual completion of the current rank. So if your circle is nearly full you will reach the next rank with a few points."
faq_text_1_newbie_friendly = "The diagram displays the overall experience of the user. But it depends on the number of ranks, not on the required experiences for the ranks.<br />
Lets take a look at an example:<br />
We have 5 ranks, are in the 3rd rank, have 18 points, the 3rd rank starts with 15 points and ends with 25.<br />
At first we cut the diagram in 5 (the number of ranks) pieces:<br />
<pre>|&nbsp;1&nbsp;|&nbsp;2&nbsp;|&nbsp;3&nbsp;|&nbsp;4&nbsp;|&nbsp;5&nbsp;|</pre>
We are in rank 3, so the first 2 are finished:<br />
<pre>|###|###|&nbsp;3&nbsp;|&nbsp;4&nbsp;|&nbsp;5&nbsp;|</pre>
Now we add the percentual completion of our current rank. This is 100 * ((18 - 15) / (25 - 15)) = 30 %%:
<pre>|###|###|#&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;4&nbsp;|&nbsp;5&nbsp;|</pre>
Now lets see the real diagram:<br />
<img alt=\"experience diagram\" src=\"%s\" align=\"bottom\" /><br />
<br />
The circle on the left represents the percentual completion of the current rank. So if your circle is nearly full you will reach the next rank with a few points."

of the password. This hash can not be converted to the password.<br />
But you can choose a new password. Please use the &quot;forgot-password-function&quot; you can find for example on
the login-page and enter your email-address. The board will send an email to this address with a link where
you can define your new password.<br />
Make sure that you DON'T give this link to anyone else!"
faq_text_5 = "Yes the board is using cookies. But not to spy you out but only to your comfort.
Your username and password will be saved if you're logging in so that you will be loggedin automaticly

you can simply logout when you're finished. This will delete the cookies which have been set by the board.<br />"

faq_text_9 = "Yes you can configure either at the registration or afterwards in your profile how the board should act when
displaying your email-address.
<ul>
	<li><b>Hide completly</b><br />
	Like you may already guess the email-address wouldn't be displayed at any location in the board.</li>
	<li><b>Jumble address</b><br />
	In this case your address will be displayed but the board will &quot;modify&quot; your email-address so that it's harder for bots to read<br />
	For example:<br />
	Your address is &quot;max@provider.de&quot;. This would be modified to: &quot;max [at] provider [dot] de&quot;.</li>
	<li><b>Show address</b><br />
	Will simply show your address</li>
</ul>
<br />
But it is possible to send you an email with the email-formular in the board (without seeing your address); although you've set &quot;hide completly&quot;.
If you don't want this you can disable the setting &quot;Allow board emails&quot; in your profile (or at the registration)."

&middot; PMs (1) &middot; ...&quot;). The number between the brackets is the number of unread PMs in your inbox
