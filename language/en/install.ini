In the previous versions the board has just saved the text written by the user in the database and it was required
to convert the text each time you wanted to display it. This was very slowly and therefore it has been changed now.<br />
In this version the board saves additionally to the text written by the user the converted text in the database.
That means that directy after you submit the message the text will be converted and the result will be stored
in the database.<br />
This <b>improves the performance of the message-display</b> noticable.<br />
<br />
But the <b>disadvantage</b> is that it is <b>no longer possible to react dynamicly to changes</b> of the smileys, badwords or other

<br />
But the so called \"DB-Cache\" can be recalculated in the adminarea.<br />
That means if you have changed something in the database you should (depending on which table you have changed) recalculate the cache
of the table you have modified at Maintenance -> DB-Cache.<br />
<br />
Additionally some of the MySQL-tables are connected / related to each other. For example the topics-table stores
the number of replies.<br />
